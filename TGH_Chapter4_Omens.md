# The Glastenbury Horror

### Chapter Four: Omens

You wave to Tom one last time as you part ways, him along Black Brook to the north, and you along the old road to the northeast.

Less than 100 yards from the trailhead, you cast your flashlight onto an old, dilapidated wooden post and sign with “Glastenbury” carved above an arrow pointing eastwards into the thickening woods. You turn the beam of light up the trail and peer as far as you can, the details of the dark forest seeming to swallow up the light after 50 feet or so. You remind yourself that the sun will rise in a few hours, and by the time you get close to the ghost town you’ll be operating by daylight. All you have before you is a dark hike, nothing you haven’t done before.

You start up the path and take in the forest around you. Once you get moving your nerves settle into the physical activity, and your brain is able to focus on the task at hand. The forest really is quite beautiful. With each step there is a satisfying crunch and swoosh of leaves beneath your feet. The paths around Black Brook were scattered with stones, but this trail and the surrounding woods seem free of rock. The ground isn’t frozen solid yet and you step upon decaying leaves and soft earth. Tree trunks are wrapped in blankets of thick, dark green moss, and the needled evergreens bristle in the wind.

The trail quickly thins from two shoulder widths wide to only one, and even then you find yourself stepping carefully to avoid trampling small saplings which burst up in the middle of the path. Unlike trails you’ve hiked in national or state parks, this way is only ever sparsely traveled anymore, if at all. You wonder how long it’s been since someone else must have come this way. One could reach the summit and the Goddard Shelter by way of The Long Trail, but this trail seems nearly overgrown. You reference your compass to ensure you’re on track, and it seems that you are.

You check your phone to see how long it’s been and the clock reads 5:51 — about an hour — and decide to take a quick break. You also see that you don’t have any cell reception. *Expensive watch*, you joke to yourself. You sip from your water bottle, and turn your flashlight off for a moment to gauge the coming dawn. It’s still too dark to hike without light, but perhaps in another hour the pale gray sky will brighten enough. Hefting your pack onto your back again, you hear a rustle off to the side — a squirrel or other small animal you guess.

You click the flashlight back on and cast the beam over towards the sound. The leaves are still but a branch is swinging up and down as if something had just moved off it. “A squirrel for sure,” you say quietly to yourself, shifting the beam up the small tree until you see something, but not what you expected. About eight feet up the tree trunk, you see a mark. It appears to be carved, but the tree has since repaired itself, suggesting it is old, but how old you cannot say. In a space a little larger than your hand with fingers outstretched, is a counter-clockwise spiral, with two dots horizontal to each other in the center.

You gaze at it curiously, considering Celtic legends you read in preparation for the trip. Aha, you think to yourself pulling out your phone to snap a picture of the symbol. Something like a whisper causes you to pocket your phone and spin around, sweeping your light slowly through the woods. You consider calling out a “hello” but the word is caught in your throat. As you complete your sweep and find the light once again illuminating the path forward, near the side of the trail, there is a small rock cairn you had not noticed before.

*Maybe it’s just a trail marker… I’ve stopped long enough*, you think, not speaking aloud to yourself in your usual fashion. You start moving again, keeping your brain and body focused on the journey. Over the course of the next hour, you see the spiral twice more. Each time on a tree with a moving branch, as if the squirrels or birds were pointing them out to you, and each time you swear you could hear a whisper behind you. You don’t stop for them again, but more than once feel as though you’re being watched. You manage to convince yourself it’s just nerves, or the feeling of being in the woods alone surrounded by wildlife which watches you as you go.

As the gray sky gives way to soft yellow light, you click your flashlight off and a sense of relief washes over you. You wipe a smear of sweat off your forehead. The hike started off easy but between the incline and the temperature shift from cold to warm, you’re grateful for your preparation but find yourself hot. You unzip your coat and allow yourself to vent from your neck and chest. You take a sharp sniff and smell your sweat, then lift your nose to replace the smell of body odor with that of fresh autumn.

Gazing through the bare branches from the ridge you find yourself on, you can see old structures down in the valley before you. *Glastenbury Town, I’m almost there.* A smile crosses your lips as you continue down the hill towards the ruins of the town. You can make out the triangular tip on the tallest building, which was once a casino, and see the roof of a small building across a thin ravine that runs through town. Another roof nearby looks collapsed, and you can see gaps in the trees where piles of rubble rest. Continuing downwards you pass by the remains of an old stone foundation, now overgrown and covered in moss. The history of the town unfolds all around you.

You trip, shouting out and taking a hard fall. Quickly you reach out your hands to catch yourself, but your right hand hits warm mud, slips, and you end up on the ground. You sit up and assess your situation. You tripped on an old rail spike jutting out of the ground, this fall reminds you to stay observant for hazards in this area. You go to roll your pant leg up, but your hand is warm and covered in…what stinks? You smell the mud on your hand and look at the spot on the ground you reached for. It’s not mud, but some kind of animal feces, bear if you had to guess. You shake your head to ward off the shock of the fall, but as your senses return, you realize the warmth of the dung indicates its freshness and you quickly get up and look around.

You don’t need to look long before you see a moderate sized black bear tromping along the ravine just to the south of the town, maybe 500 feet away. It’s facing towards you and it probably heard you shout as you fell. You shout out a loud “HEY BEAR!” but it doesn’t seem deterred. You shout again, and again, but the bear starts to slowly plod towards you.

“Shit,” you say to yourself. You’re the same distance from the bear and the first of the dilapidated buildings. You know enough not to run if you don’t have to, and definitely not to climb a tree. Those old buildings may not hold up great, but they probably hold up better than your coat against a bear, so you start to walk briskly towards the buildings keeping your head towards the bear, shouting out a “HEY BEAR” now and then as you walk.

You get about halfway and are out of the thick of the woods, when the bear stands upon its hind legs and bellows out a growling roar. You respond with another shout, but the beast seems undeterred. You keep your eyes on it, but glance around looking for anything that could help, but all you see simply gives you more confusion.

You’re backpedaling through a garden that looks like it’s been cared for, and accidentally put your foot through a big pumpkin. You shake it off quickly and the bear begins to increase its pace towards you. You’re less than 100 feet from the door of the nearest small house, and it’s now or never. You turn and run, and you can hear the bear growl behind you. A murder of crows lift off from the triangle spire of the old casino building across the ravine and you swear you could see a light go out in one of the windows but there’s no time.

You can still hear the grunting of the bear behind you as you get to the door. “Please, oh please be open,” you say as you tear hard on the door, but it doesn’t budge. You drive your shoulder into the door and you stumble in, slamming it behind you, rattling some broken glass in a nearby window-pane. You shut your eyes hard and hold the door, expecting the bear to try to get in after you. You hear the thudding of its steps, the low growl and then the bear…shrieks? You open your eyes and see a shadow flicker beyond the filthy and broken glass of a nearby window.

Your heartbeat throbs in your ears, and your breath echoes around the dark and musty space. As your breathing slows, you realize the sound doesn’t dampen, and you hold your ear to the door to realize it isn’t your breath you’re hearing. It sounds like a loud and raspy wheezing outside - perhaps the bear. Despite it being morning, sunlight fails to penetrate the thick dust and moss growing on the windows, and you can’t see well inside here. You fumble your flashlight out of your pocket and take a look around the building.

It looks like a single room, an old rat-chewed oval knit rug taking over the center of the floor. Shards of glass and a broken toppled side table lay littered over the floor alongside a cracked portrait frame and drinkware. In the far corner is a rotting wooden bedframe, whose mattress or sheets have long since fed rodents and made nesting for birds. A partially collapsed stone fireplace rests against the wall, and in the far corner beyond that you see what appears to be…a hatch? On the hatch is the same counter-clockwise spiral with horizontal dots carved into it, or at least you think it is.

The raspy breathing outside has stopped, and you’re left in an eerie silence. You pull out your phone to look at the picture you had taken of the symbol earlier to be sure that it’s the same. The symbols match, and in the photo you’re now noticing two small red dots lingering behind the base of the tree that was marked, are those eyes?

You pocket your phone and take a deep breath. Suddenly all the rumors and stories don’t seem as implausible anymore. You listen at the door again and don’t hear anything but the wind and the occasional caw of a crow. The bear could still be out there, but so is the town you came to explore. You look towards the hatch with the spiral and realize there may also be more to explore in here. There’s a partially broken window on the back side of the house you might be able to open or break and go back the way you came if it all feels like too much. You take another few minutes to steady yourself, catch your breath, and mull your options over.
