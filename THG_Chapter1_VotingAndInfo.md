FIRST CHAPTER INFORMATION

Title: The Glastenbury Horror
Penname: John Skoda
Description: Glastenbury in Vermont, USA has been a place of murder, mystery, and obscure folklore for centuries. Take on the role of a modern outdoorsy adventurer as you embark upon a brave week-long camping trip in the 36 square mile heavily wooded area surrounding Glastenbury Mountain, known infamously as The Bennington Triangle. Keep your wits about you, trust your instincts, and rely on what you know, see, and feel. You practice leave no trace, yet what lurks in those woodlands may not be so courteous.
