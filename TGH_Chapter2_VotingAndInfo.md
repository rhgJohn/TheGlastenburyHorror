Description: Glastenbury in Vermont, USA has been a place of murder, mystery, and obscure folklore for centuries. You've arrived in nearby Bennington and decided to visit a place called The Green Gopher Pub. There, almost set back in time, you'll meet some helpful people and hopefully heed the lessons within the stories they have to share. You'll be setting out soon, and you could use whatever help you can get...that or whatever feels most safe.
